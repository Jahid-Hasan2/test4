# CryptoPrice-App
The app is a modified version of a crypto tracking app which is made for improvement by anybody legally. I have added a new tab which shows the top 100 exchanges in a short list. It also shows the 24-hour BTC trading volume update. The news tab will show the crypto related updated news. Anybody can modify the app without any hesitation but you are requested to use your won api keys.

## What's New
- Added a new tab for crypto related news
- Added a new tab that shows the Top 100 exchanges and their 24 hour BTC trading volume normalised
